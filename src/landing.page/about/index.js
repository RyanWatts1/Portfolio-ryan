          I enjoy creating things that live on the web. I use patterns to
          deliver excellent UI. Programming is a passion for me and it all
          started with my first Hello World. Steve Jobs once said "Your work is
          going to fill a large part of your life, and the only way to be truly
          satisfied is to do what you believe is great work. And the only way to
          do great work is to love what you do. If you haven't found it yet,
          keep looking". My answer to that question is programming. Creating
          unique websites for the interent leaves me endlessly inspired. Each
          morning I wake up at 6:00AM to begin my coding journey.

          I have acquired project and time managment skills through working with
          clients to build their ideal website efficiently. I also sharpened my
          communication skill while working with team members and clients. As a
          salesman by day and a developer by night I learned optimal time
          management skills to reach my goals in both sales and web development
          projects.
